# SQL

## Main features

SQL stands for Structured Query Language and it’s purpose is to make it easier to retrieve specific information from databases. It is a relational database which means that it has a very rigid structuring to it.

## When to use

It is best to use SQL when queries are large and complex because it is very structured and relational.

## Advantages

SQL is widely-used meaning that it is reliable, secure, and actively maintained.

## Disadvantages

SQL is quite restrictive with its pre-defined schemas meaning that you have less flexibility.

# NoSQL

## Main features

NoSQL are non-relational and can have next to no structure with makes it a far more flexible option.

## When to use

It is best to use NoSQL when objects and children will often be changing. That way you are taking advantage of the flexibility of NoSQL.

## Advantages

NoSQL uses dynamic schemas meaning that it can change and be used the exact way you want it.

## Disadvantages

Since it is so flexible, the integrity of the data is not always perfect. In addition to security, NoSQL doesn’t support relationships between data types.

# Differences

The differences between SQL and NoSQL are that SQL is rigid where as NoSQL is flexible with their schemas. Next, SQL is far more secure than NoSQL since it uses such rigid structures. Finally, SQL is faster than NoSQL because of it’s structure.
