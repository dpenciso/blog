## Functions

# How to declare a function.

There are different ways to declare a function. Here are three:

- <code>function name() {}</code>

- <code>const name = function() {}</code>

- <code>const name = () => {}</code>

# How to return a value from a funciton.

To return a value from a function, put <code>return</code> followed by the thing you want to return inside of the funtion like so:

- <code>const name = () => {
    let x = 1 return x
    }</code>
